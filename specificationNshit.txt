Save Handler --

Front End: Send post parameters in the form (for example):
	id : "14"
	name : "Pick and Roll"
	numFrames : "50"
	paths : <stringify Location[][]>

	(If it's a new play and doesn't have an ID yet, send -1)

Back End: Parses play info, sends back map from play id to name:
	plays : Map<Integer, String>

	(So that you can display the full list of plays to the user after saving)

	"play" : {
				id : "14"
				name: "Pick and Roll"
				numFrames : "50"
				paths : <Stringified Location[][]>
			 }
