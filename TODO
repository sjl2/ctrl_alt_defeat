Nick:
	Autocomplete doesn't always work

Tyler:
	Start positions for tokens
	Ball following player
	http://getbootstrap.com/components/
	Ball doesn't change it's first frame. 
	If player with possesion is being edited, the ball's future path should 	also be cleared. 
	Ball sometimes get's lost

Nick/Tyler:
   Change dy from 0 to 7.5 (Should fix wierd offset issue)

Playmaker bugs:
 - Move player, edit his starting position, play, console errors
 - Load a play, both sf's and the red pf are unmovable
 - Show user that they are editting default pos's even when sidebar is closed
 - New play button doesn't clear max frame, tons of console errors when you press play
