Tyler:
 - Ball doesn't change it's first frame. 
 - If player with possesion is being edited, the ball's future path should also be cleared. 
 - Ball sometimes get's lost
 - Show user that they are editting default pos's even when sidebar is closed
 - Load a play, delete it, play can still be run
 - Move play title to center of court so that button doesn't block it
     
var path = paper.path("path string");
path.setAttribute("attribute name", value);
path attr = "d"
stroke-width
stroke-dasharray
stroke = stroke-color
stroke-opacity
maybe can do this in css for path?

Lineup Analytics Notes
 - Get all 5 player id's from dropdown lists
 - Select all offensive stats from db for those players in the current championship years
 - Bin all the stats into a map
 - Discount bins where number of stats doesn't exceed the threshold
 - Calculate the value of each bin (shots are worth their value, misses are worth a value
   so that an average shooter ends up with a score of 0. Look up offensive value of ast,
   orb, tov, off-foul
 - Determine which bins the team won vs lost, calculate a value (maybe value of bin * constant, plus
   constant for any bins team did not meet threshold for)
 - Return constant. Bitchez.

 Other analytics - Heatmaps for season, shot chart for last five games, (hover over player in select list
   for individual heatmap / shot chart?)
